# Dormitory-Cafeteria-App
This application was developed due to the inadequacy of the old receipt system in the dorm cafeteria. The cashier takes orders and preferences from students, then sends them to the View screen for the kitchen staff to prepare. Once ready, the staff marks orders as delivered. This streamlines order management efficiently.
